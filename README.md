**NOTICE**

This repository is abandoned in favor of ongoing development on
[git.sr.ht](https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/aerc2). The codebase has been rewritten
in Go and is much more stable and useful than what you see here.

# aerc

aerc is a **work in progress** asynchronous email client for your terminal. aerc
is network-first, and is designed with network-based email protocols in mind. It
runs all network code in separate worker threads that don't lock up the UI.
Compared to mutt, it's also easier on the network and much faster - it only
fetches what it needs.
